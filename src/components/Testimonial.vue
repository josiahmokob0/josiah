                  Josiah was part of a 3 person team developing full-stack
                  React/Node/Postgres applications. I challenged the team
                  to learn d3, SVG, CSS, and HTML5 in a deeper way, and to
                  switch from GraphQL to using Django and a REST interface.
                  Josiah dug in and became familiar with the d3 way which is
                  very different from a React component approach. His ability
                  to face challenges directly and overcome them, plus an
                  ability to learn new technologies quickly makes him a strong
                  asset for any team. I would gladly work with him again.

                   Josiah is an absolute pleasure to work with. We collaborated
                    on a variety of projects, and he has shown an ability to
                    tackle difficult issues with ease. He is also adept at offering
                    novel solutions to persistent issues. When our team faced the
                    challenge of integrating with third-party software platforms,
                    Josiah quickly picked up the baton and saw a way to make the
                    process more automated. He implemented a solution, and the result
                    was that our third-party integrations became much more efficient.
                    He has worked on several disparate teams and projects within our
                    company, from frontend and UI design to building data pipelines.
                    His communication and leadership skills are invaluable assets as well.
                    I'd recommend Josiah as part of any team.
