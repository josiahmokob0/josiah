        "Text": "Josiah was part of a 3 person team developing full-stack React/Node/Postgres applications. I challenged the team to learn d3, SVG, CSS, and HTML5 in a deeper way, and to switch from GraphQL to using Django and a REST interface. Josiah dug in and became familiar with the d3 way which is very different from a React component approach. His ability to face challenges directly and overcome them, plus an ability to learn new technologies quickly makes him a strong asset for any team. I would gladly work with him again.",

        "Text": "Josiah is an absolute pleasure to work with. We collaborated on a variety of projects, and he has shown an ability to tackle difficult issues with ease. He is also adept at offering novel solutions to persistent issues. When our team faced the challenge of integrating with third-party software platforms, Josiah quickly picked up the baton and saw a way to make the process more automated. He implemented a solution, and the result was that our third-party integrations became much more efficient. He has worked on several disparate teams and projects within our company, from frontend and UI design to building data pipelines. His communication and leadership skills are invaluable assets as well. I'd recommend Josiah as part of any team.",
